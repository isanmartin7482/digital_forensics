1. Bandwith is the ammount of data that can be transported from one point to another in a given time period. 
2. A channel is a frequency that wifi transmits and recives data on.
3. 1, 6, and 11 are the most commonly used wifi channels because they are the only three that can operate on the same 2.4GHz frequency without overlapping. Wireless A supports a maximum theoretical transfer rate of 54 Mbps,
 and operates on the 2.4GHz frequency.  Wireless B supports a maximum theoretical transfer rate of 11mbps, and operates on the 2.4GHz frequency. Wireless G supports a maximum theoretical transfer rate of 54mbps,
 and operates on the 2.4GHz frequency. Wireless N supports a maximum theoretical transfer rate of 300mbps with 2 antennas, and operates on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. AC IEEE supports a maximum theoretical transfer rate of 1Gbps,
 and operates on both 2.4GHz and 5GHZ bands.
4. WEP - First 802.11 security standard; was easly cracked and not well protected
   WPA - Created to adress major WEP flaws; Is backwards compatible with WEP
   WPA2 - Current standard; Newer hardware ensures advanced encryption doesn't affect performance
5. WEP is the least secure because it uses RC4 stream cipher and 64-or 128-bit keys. WPA is the second most secure because it retains the use of RC4, but adds longer IVs,
 256-bit keys as well as using TKIP to provide each client with a new key. Finally, WPA2 is the most secure because it replaces RC4 and TKIP with CCMP and AES for stronger authentication.
6. Airsnort is a linux utility used for decrypting WEP encryption on 802.11b network. 
7. Kismet is an 802.11 wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system.
8.KARMA is a set of tools for assessing the security of wireless clients at multiple layers. Wireless sniffing tools discover clients and their preferred/trusted networks by passively listening for 802.11 Probe Request frames.
